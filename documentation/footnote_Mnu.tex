\paragraph{$^{$FOOTNOTE_NUMBER$}$The neutrino masses} exist in two flavours. \verb+RawNeutrinoMass+ is 
obtained by simply summing the neutrino particle masses, while the noise suppressed version, 
\verb+NoiseSuppressedNeutrinoMass+ is defined as

\begin{equation}
    M_{\nu{},{\rm{}NS}} = \sum_i m_i w_i + \frac{4\pi{}}{3} \rho{}_{\nu{}} R_{\rm{}SO}^3,
\end{equation}

where $w_i$ are the neutrino weights (which can be negative), and $\rho{}_{\nu{}}$ is the background density 
of neutrinos that is also used in the SO radius calculation. The latter is obtained from the snapshot header.
