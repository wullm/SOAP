SO_properties.py

Halo properties within spherical overdensities. These include
all particles within a radius that is set by the halo density
profile and some threshold density.

Just like the other HaloProperty implementations, the calculation of the
properties is done lazily: only calculations that are actually needed are
performed. A fully documented explanation can be found in
aperture_properties.py.

Apart from the usual halo property calculations, this file also
contains the spherical overdensity radius calculation, which is
somewhat more involved than simply using a fixed aperture.

Contrary to the other halo types, spherical overdensities are only
calculated for central halos (VR/StructureType == 10). SO properties
are also only calculated if an SO radius could be determined.

    """
    Find the radius and mass of an SO from the ordered density and cumulative
    mass profiles.

    The profiles are constructed by sorting the particles within the spherical
    region and then summing their masses in that order (assigning the full
    mass of the particle to the particle's radius). The density for every radius
    is then computed by dividing the cumulative mass profile by the volume of a
    sphere with that radius.

    The SO radius is defined as the radius at which the density profile dips
    below the given reference density. Unfortunately, real density profiles
    are noisy and can sometimes fluctuate around the threshold. We therefore
    define the SO radius as the first radius for which this happens, at machine
    precision.
    If no particles are below the threshold, then we raise an error and force an
    increase of the search radius.
    If all particles are below the threshold, we assume that the cumulative
    mass profile of the halo is linear out to the radius of the first particle,
    and then use the corresponding density profile to find the intersection.
    In all other cases, we find the actual SO radius by assuming a linear
    cumulative mass profile in the bin where the density dips below the
    threshold, and intersecting the corresponding density profile with the
    threshold. This approach requires a root finding algorithm and does not
    yield exactly the same result as linear interpolation in r-log(rho) space
    for the same bin (which is for example used by VELOCIraptor). It however
    guarantees that the SO mass we find is contained within the intersecting
    bin, which would otherwise not necessarily be true (especially if the
    intersecting bin is relatively wide). We could also interpolate both the
    radius and mass, but then the mean density of the SO would not necessarily
    match the target density, which is also weird.

    Parameters:
     - ordered_radius: unyt.unyt_array
       Sorted radius of the particles.
     - density: unyt.unyt_array
       Density of the particles (also sorted on radius).
     - cumulative_mass: unyt.unyt_array
       Cumulative mass profile of the particles (also sorted on radius).
     - reference_density: unyt.unyt_quantity
       Target threshold density.

    Returns the radius, mass and volume of the sphere where the density
    reaches the target value.

    Throws a ReadRadiusTooSmallError if the intersection point is outside
    the range of the particles that were passed on.

    Throws a RuntimeError if the intersection point is outside the range and
    the current search radius is larger than 20 Mpc.
