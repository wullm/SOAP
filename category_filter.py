category_filter.py

Filter used to determine which halo properties should be computed.
This decision is based on the number of particles in the FOF subhalo and
the category a particular halo property belongs to.

There are 6 categories:
 - basic: Always computed.
 - general: Only computed if the total number of particles exceeds a threshold.
 - gas: Only computed if the number of gas particles exceeds a threshold.
 - dm: Only computed if the number of dark matter particles exceeds a threshold.
 - star: Only computed if the number of star particles exceeds a threshold.
 - baryon: Only computed if the number of baryon (gas + star) particles exceeds a threshold.

Additionally, this object also marks properties that should not be computed for DMO runs.

The filter thresholds for the 5 categories that use a threshold are read from the parameter
file. The corresponding particle numbers are hardcoded to be read from the
FOFSubhaloProperties properties.
