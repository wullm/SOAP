category_filter.py

Filter used to determine which halo properties should be computed.
This decision is based on the number of particles in the subhalo and
the category a particular halo property belongs to.

There are 6 categories:
 - basic: Always computed.
 - general: Only computed if the total number of particles exceeds a threshold.
 - gas: Only computed if the number of gas particles exceeds a threshold.
 - dm: Only computed if the number of dark matter particles exceeds a threshold.
 - star: Only computed if the number of star particles exceeds a threshold.
 - baryon: Only computed if the number of baryon (gas + star) particles exceeds a threshold.

Additionally, this object also marks properties that should not be computed for DMO runs.

The filter thresholds for the 5 categories that use a threshold are read from the parameter
file. The corresponding particle numbers are hardcoded to be read from the
BoundSubhalo properties.

           masked (i.e. set to zero) if the sum of the elements in Mask Datasets is
           strictly below this value.

           values. Describes how the datasets were combined before comparing to the
